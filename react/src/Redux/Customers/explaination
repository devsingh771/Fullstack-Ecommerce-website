The code you've provided is part of a Redux setup for managing the state of a shopping cart in a React application. Let's break down the relationship between these files and the concepts involved:

Action Creators (action.jsx): These are functions that dispatch actions to the Redux store. They handle asynchronous operations (like API calls) and dispatch the appropriate actions based on the result of these operations.
Action Types (actiontype.jsx): These are constants representing the types of actions that can be dispatched to the Redux store. They help avoid typos and provide a single source of truth for action types.
Reducer (reducer.jsx): This is a function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. It updates the state based on the action type and payload.



1. Action Creators (action.jsx)
Action creators are functions that create and return action objects. In this code, they are used to perform asynchronous operations (API calls) using axios and dispatch actions based on the results of these operations.
